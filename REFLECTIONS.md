# Developer's Reflections: The Journey of EclipsoTrack

As a lifelong space enthusiast, I’ve always been captivated by the mysteries of the cosmos. The idea for **EclipsoTrack** was born from my passion to stay up-to-date with celestial events, marvel at the real-time motion of the ISS, and immerse myself in the ever-changing universe of space news. Yet, as with any dream, the path from inspiration to implementation has been fraught with obstacles and profound moments of self-reflection.

## 1. The Vision vs. Reality

The initial spark for EclipsoTrack was fueled by nostalgic memories of my younger self—thirteen-year-old me, mesmerized by books detailing celestial events, astronomy, and the profound questions of existentialism. I envisioned an interactive portal where users could track upcoming events and witness the dynamic beauty of space. However, as I transitioned from a conceptual sketch on paper to actual code, the complexities of modern web development quickly became apparent. Working with Next.js 15 and integrating multiple external APIs (NASA, AstronomyAPI, etc.) unveiled a gap between my imaginative vision and the stark technical challenges of making it real.

## 2. Technical Hurdles and Emotional Exhaustion

I spent countless hours debugging, rewriting, and refining my code. Each new obstacle seemed to stretch my patience further:

- **Persistent Bugs:**  
  Features like the Three.js-powered interactive star map demanded intricate handling. Every time I thought I’d solved an issue, a new one emerged.

- **Real-Time Data Integration:**  
  Capturing live data for celestial events and the fast-moving ISS (zooming by at 28,000 km/h) was as exhilarating as it was demanding.

- **Emotional Toll:**  
  There were days when the frustration and fatigue made me seriously consider abandoning a project that is so close to my heart. The relentless cycle of error messages and unresolved issues often left me questioning my own capabilities.

## 3. The Challenge of Real-Time Data

Real-time tracking of the ISS and the dynamic display of NASA’s Astronomy Picture of the Day represented the pinnacle of technical challenge:

- **Local vs. Deployed Environment:**  
  On my localhost, everything functioned seamlessly. Yet, upon deployment, the application began to falter with recurring errors like “failed to fetch, try again.”

- **Critical Features Impacted:**  
  The failure to reliably fetch data not only disrupted the user experience but also chipped away at my confidence, making every new deployment feel like a gamble.

## 4. Deployment Dilemmas and Time Pressure

The shift from development to deployment opened up a new set of problems:

- **Environmental Discrepancies:**  
  Subtle differences between my local setup and the production environment led to unexpected behaviors that were incredibly difficult to diagnose.

- **Time Constraints:**  
  Balancing this intensive project with exam preparations and a limited holiday period intensified the pressure. It was as if time itself was slipping through my fingers—like sand—while I battled to meet both academic and personal milestones.

## 5. Embracing AI: A Double-Edged Sword

In a bid to overcome persistent issues, I turned to AI tools and large language models:

- **Leveraging LLMs:**  
  I utilized tools like Claude Sonnet 3.7 to refine the Three.js components and DeepSeek to resolve data fetching problems. These AI models were incredibly powerful, often fixing issues in just a few attempts.

- **Conflicted Emotions:**  
  While it was astonishing to witness such efficiency, I couldn’t shake off the feeling that I was outsourcing a significant part of my creative process. The realization that I was becoming a “passenger on this AI train” stirred a mix of relief and self-doubt.

- **Reinventing the Wheel?:**  
  Despite initial reluctance, I eventually accepted that integrating AI was not a weakness but rather a pragmatic evolution in my development process—one that allowed me to focus on creativity and higher-level design.

## 6. Personal Struggles and Identity Crisis

The technical challenges were intertwined with deep personal reflections:

- **Self-Doubt:**  
  As a computer engineering student juggling academics and this passion project, I often felt like a "jack of all trades, master of none." The constant battle with code left me questioning my own expertise and worth.

- **Emotional Isolation:**  
  In moments of solitude, the weight of expectation and fear of failure became overwhelming. I worried that my vision might never materialize, that I was chasing an impossible dream.

- **Rediscovering My Roots:**  
  Despite the challenges, every setback reminded me of that young, curious mind that once reveled in the mysteries of space. That internal spark still burns bright, urging me to push forward and embrace both success and failure as part of the journey.

## 7. Reflections on the Future and Adaptation

Even amid the chaos and technical setbacks, I’ve learned invaluable lessons:

- **Growth Through Adversity:**  
  Every challenge has been a stepping stone, teaching me resilience, adaptability, and the importance of leveraging new technologies.

- **Balancing Passion and Pragmatism:**  
  I’ve come to understand that relying on AI and modern tools doesn’t diminish my creative input—it enhances it. The blend of human ingenuity with machine efficiency is not a compromise but a collaboration.

- **A Vision Reborn:**  
  While there have been moments when the fear of failure loomed large, I’ve learned that the true essence of EclipsoTrack lies in its journey. It’s a testament to my passion for space, the lessons learned along the way, and the ever-present drive to explore both the cosmos and the limits of my own potential.

## Conclusion

Completing **EclipsoTrack** has been an enriching and transformative journey, one that spanned 8-12 weeks of hard work, self-doubt, and moments of profound insight. This project is not just a web application—it’s a chronicle of my personal and technical evolution. Every line of code, every frustrating bug, and every breakthrough reflects a story of perseverance, introspection, and the relentless pursuit of progress. While the road ahead remains uncertain, I choose to see each challenge as an opportunity to learn, innovate, and ultimately share the wonder of the universe with the world. I may have become a part of the AI revolution, but at the core, it is my passion and curiosity that continue to propel me forward.
